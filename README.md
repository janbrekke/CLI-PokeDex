# CLI-PokeDex - PRG Exam

A CLI based Pokemon lookup. 

### Prerequisites

You will need some modules to make this work..

```
* requests
* unicurses
* argparse
```
This project uses UniCurses (yes i know it's old) to make is X-Platform. Due to this the DLL file needs to follow the project file. I think you could also place it into your interpreter folder.

**Windows:**

(ex: C:\user\<username>\appdata\local\programs\python\<python version>\)

**Linux:**

(ex: /usr/bin/python)

Think you can run "***whereis python3.6***" (change 3.6 to what ever version you have) too to find it.
Don't arrest me if I'm wrong here..

NOT 100% sure about this :P

### Installing

To install the Prerequisites, simply run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
